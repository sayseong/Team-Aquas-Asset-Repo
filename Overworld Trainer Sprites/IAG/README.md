## IAG's Assorted OW Trainer Sprites

All sprites use the RSE style (facing towards the camera rather than forwards on the perspective plane).

As indexed PNGs, they can be dropped directly into pokeemerald-expansion and work out of the box; no need for a `.pal` file.

If you use any of these sprites, please credit IAG.
