Pasting from Discord:

Had this lying around from a few years ago. Should make it easier for anyone wanting to make something like the “Emerald Version” logo. Been super busy lately, but eventually would be nice to make a real tutorial on the wiki.

Prereqs:
Affinity Designer
Futura font
Aseprite (or something like it)

In Affinity Designer, after making your changes, go to the Export Persona and press Export Slices to generate the 2 halves of the image.

Then in Aseprite, open those two exported images, as well as graphics/title_screen/emerald_version.png from your repo. For both images, if you select all, copy, then paste into the emerald_version.png, Aseprite should handle the palette automatically. (Of course if you changed any colors in the logo in Designer, you’ll need to fix the palette yourself.)

Doesn’t make an exact replica, but it’s pretty close
