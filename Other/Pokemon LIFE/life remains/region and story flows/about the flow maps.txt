nodes are color coded:
green ones only accesible after cut HM1.
blue ones are water routes HM SURF.
dark blue is dive routes.
red is after obtaining HM SACRED FIRE, a nerfed version of the sacred fire move. would open the entrance to a bunch of sealed caves.
brown is rock climb.

some flow graphs represent region maps:
OHANA FARM
NENDIOS
NORTH NENDIOS

other ones represent sequence of events or just an arrangement of ideas.

not everything is in these flow maps. late-game events (like the main apocalypse, are not quite well described)

if you are going to try to sew the story together through the nodes, a recommend reading the story.txt file first.

i used articy:draft to make them.
