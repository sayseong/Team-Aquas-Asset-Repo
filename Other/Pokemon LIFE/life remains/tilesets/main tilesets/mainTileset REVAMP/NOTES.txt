this is the tileset I was going to use in the final revamp of the game. i ended up only making a city (with 2 versions) and a foggy route before stopping development.
different from the first mainTileset, this one was made from scratch at once, so it's much more organized (usually hacks with custom tiles are very frankenstein like).

i believe you can't get more b/w/b2/w2 than this in the gba engine.
with some palette changes, you can get any season you want!
feel free to use it in any way.

check general credits.
