a lot of the fun I had when writing this story was not letting it clear if the characters in the hack were
supposed to be the same characters from the original games or not.
"why is blake the father?" was a common commentary. is he really blake? no.
is mom the N caretaker person from the b/w games? no.

but benga is Benga from b/w/b2/w2. lola is Yancy from b2/w2 before stardom.
i was trying to do some sort of alternative prequel to the b/w games. and it worked fine, at least in my head.
