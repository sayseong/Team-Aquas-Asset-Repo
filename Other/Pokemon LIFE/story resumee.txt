[player]'s mom disappears.
the story revolved around jirachi trying to convince [player] to wish for his/her mother back to life.
benga being tsundere (and searching for alder) and lola being comic relief.
hoopa had his powers sealed by jirachi hundreds of years ago, and warns [player] about how dangerous jirachi is.
wallace takes everyone to unova and, there, [player] touches a crystal fragment. he sees the moment lunala "captures" his mother.
after a bunch of gym badges and defeating lunala, she tell everyone that she did it because owed a favor to jirachi.

~backstory~
Jirachi was the original pokémon. He realized his own wish, "to have a friend". the friend/brother/twin was arceus.
arceus wished for control. dialga, palkia and giratina were born. giratina rebelled, and wished for his own world.
jirachi realized a bunch of other wishes:
alder whised for eternal life.
lunala wished for praise (and thus there is only traces of a Solgaleo Ghost you could find).
a musharna wished for power (dreamyard happened).
and a lot more things that i forgot.
after seeing the mess that these wishes caused, arceus betrayed jirachi and "banned" him. condemned to be able to only grant wishes, every X days.
frustrated, jirachi wants his powers back.
~end of backstory~

the whole climax involves the fact that jirachi wanted the player to wish for someone that was alive (but held captive, unknowingly to everyone then), to come back to life.
this would cause a "glitch in the matrix" and, given that the whishes HAD to be granted, he would need to bring something new to life.
he would use unbound hoopa's power to create a creature that was almost invencible.

but player won't make the wish. [player] knows that jirachi is shady.
jirachi then captures [player] and sends him to another dimension (same place where the mother and alder are), and benga sees it all happening.
unaware of the complete situation, benga wishes for [player] to come back to life.
then, the whole apocalypse happens. jirachi is now inside a giant and invencible golden unbound hoopa.
hoopa manages to get everyone (except [player]'s mother, who is frozen inside a giant crystal) back to the human dimension.

arceus won't intervene. it claims that what needs to happen, will happen.

everyone meets at the top of the biggest mountain. still small, compared to unbound jirachi's size.
no one can defeat him. no one is as powerful as him.

except for some of his most powerful creations: dialga, palkia and giratina manage to drag him into the distortion world.
in the distortion world, giratina makes the rules. jirachi is not the most powerful anymore.
jirachi loses the battle and runs away. the mom is still frozen in another dimension.

after beating the elite 4, player returns to the tower where benga wished him back to life.
he sees a geisha. the geisha runs to the top of the tower.
upon reaching the top, the geisha's clothes are scattered on the floor. she is nowhere to be seen.
a shooting star is seen, and something falls from it, into player's hands. it's the item that will bring his mother back to the human dimension.

benga is chosen as the leader of an upcoming battle facility in unova, the black tower. lola, after joining the pokéstar studios, reaches stardom. (these things come out of nowhere here, but would be teased throughout the game)
after returning to his house, [player] receives a ticket to Unova, and player joins Benga and Lola in their new journey.

=========================
a just wrote this from memory. a lot of things were ommited here: 
benga tsundere plot, 
lola stardom plot, 
a lot more of hoopa/alder/zygarde,
pre-team plasma/colress/zinzolin/ghetsis plot, 
a bunch of cameos (wallace, cynthia, lenora, elesa), 
the 5 merchants (old elite 4, the strongest trainers in the region.) 
and other stuff.

i had a lot of fun creating this story throughout the years and I am very happy to finally share it, even in this a half-assed form.
feel free to use it in any way.
