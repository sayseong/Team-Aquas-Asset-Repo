-- FAQ --

Everything is free of use?
With the exception of what is masked by a semi-opaque red layer, everything is free. (I make it a point of honor to use as many free resources as possible - the ones created by the Sacred Phoenix team always are.)

What are opaque red tiles?
These are free tiles (often old tiles deleted following an optimization). The red square is to avoid using them by accident and have an altered collision.

Where are the autotiles?
In the third column. Everything is broken down into blob tilesets (47 combinations). By taking the corresponding tiles, it is easy to reconstruct it in RPG Maker format.

What is these two autotiles of semi-opaque water in third column?
These are tiles intended to cover the autotile of animated water. It allows me to get shallow water while having some animation. Combinations that cause both shore, deep and shallow water to appear are handled by a third autotile visible on this tileset.

Why are some tiles duplicated?
Because of the priority and collision management of RPG Maker XP. This allows me to have a version without collision and another with collision (typically a tree shadow that covers a non passable tile).
