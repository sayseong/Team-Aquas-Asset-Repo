I got permission from all the artists who worked on these to share them once my project was released, so you are free to use them however you want and make edits to them as desired! 

Some of the ones with custom shinies make take some finagling to make the palettes line up correctly with the base form. I know infernape for sure gave me trouble so message me on disc if you use one and the shinies are weirdly indexed or something.

Please just be sure to credit the original artist appropriately if you use one of them! I dont need to be credited if you use one, but if you dont credit the artist we will have beef :gunpossum:
